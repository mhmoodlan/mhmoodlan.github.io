A previous version of this post claimed reproducing some results from [[3](#ref3)], which was inaccurate. The post was edited to reflect those notes.*

### 1. Introduction

Inherently interpretable models are a class of models that prioritize interpretability during the optimization process, contrasting with post-hoc interpretability methods that address interpretability after training is complete. B-cos models represent an example of inherently interpretable models. For a high-level overview, refer to this [post](https://moboehle.github.io/CoDA-Nets/){:target="_blank"}, [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdLYIzWWvw){:target="_blank"}, and [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NSSzXoWa2c){:target="_blank"}. For a more in-depth treatment, consult the papers on CoDA Nets [[1](#ref1)], B-cos Nets [[2](#ref2)], and B-cos ViTs [[3](#ref3)].

In this post, I attempt to train two B-cos models on CIFAR10, namely B-cos ResNet-56 and B-cos ResNet-50 ([Section 2](#2-train-bcos)), evaluate their adversarial robustness, and compare it to naturally and adversarially trained networks, both quantitatively ([Section 3](#3-quantitative-results)) and qualitatively ([Section 4](#4-qualitative-results)). The code used to generate the results presented in this post can be found in this [notebook](https://github.com/mhmoodlan/b-cos-robustness/blob/main/b_cos_robustness.ipynb){:target="_blank"} or [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mhmoodlan/b-cos-robustness/blob/main/b_cos_robustness.ipynb).

### 2. Training B-cos ResNet-56

Executing the [published code](https://github.com/B-cos/B-cos-v2){:target="_blank"} was straightforward, {::nomarkdown}<span style="color: rgb(151 151 151); text-decoration: line-through; font-style: italic;">{:/} except for the need to modify train-requirements.txt to specify PyTorch Lightning's version to be pytorch-lightning==1.9.0, as Lighting versions from 2.0.0 upwards were incompatible{::nomarkdown}</span>{:/} [fixed]. Specifically, I trained a Bcos-ResNet-56 model on CIFAR10 by running the command:
```bash
python train.py \
     --dataset CIFAR10 \
     --base_network norm_ablations_final \
     --experiment_name resnet_56-nomaxout
```

and a B-cos ResNet-50 by running the command:

```bash
python train.py \
     --dataset CIFAR10 \
     --base_network large_nets \
     --experiment_name resnet_50
```

The obtained test accuracies were `88.06%` with 100 epochs and `87.42%` with 90 epochs, respectively. The performance could be improved with more hyperparameter tuning, especially for the B-cos ResNet-50 since it was overfitting. [Figure 1](#fig1) depicts the top-1 and top-5 accuracies on the train and evaluation sets throughout the epochs of training. The trained checkpoint weights can be downloaded from [this repository](https://github.com/mhmoodlan/b-cos-robustness/releases/v0.1.0/){:target="_blank"}.

### 3. Quantitative Results

To evaluate the adversarial robustness of the trained B-cos models, I utilized the Robustness library [[4](#ref4)]. The library provides access to naturally and adversarially pretrained ResNet-50 models ([link to pretrained models](https://github.com/madrylab/robustness#pretrained-models){:target="_blank"}). In addition, this library makes it easy to attack a custom loss function, which comes in handy in this case due to the Binary Cross-Entropy loss function employed during the B-cos models training process.

Tables [1](#table1) and [2](#table2) present the accuracies of the models against {::nomarkdown}\(\ell_\infty\){:/} and {::nomarkdown}\(\ell_2\){:/} PGD attacks, respectively.  Each cell corresponds to the accuracy achieved against (20-step/100-step) PGD attacks with a step size of `2.5 * Îµ-test / num_steps`, following [[4](#ref4)]. The Adv-ResNet-50 model in [Table 1](#table1) is an {::nomarkdown}\(\ell_\infty\) {:/} adversarially trained model with {::nomarkdown}\(\epsilon=8/255\){:/} ([model checkpoint](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c9qlt1lbdnu9tlo/cifar_linf_8.pt?dl=0){:target="_blank"}), while in [Table 2](#table2) it is an {::nomarkdown}\(\ell_2\) {:/} adversarially trained model with {::nomarkdown}\(\epsilon=0.5\){:/} ([model checkpoint](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1zazwjfzee7c8i4/cifar_l2_0_5.pt?dl=0){:target="_blank"}).

> It is important to note that the results presented herein should be interpreted with caution due to the disparity in architecture and data augmentation pipelines employed for the B-cos ResNet-56 model and the provided ResNet-50 models. In addition, due to computational limitations, no detailed hyperparameter tuning was done for the B-cos ResNet-50.

In contrast to naturally trained models, B-cos networks exhibited inherent robustness, particularly against {::nomarkdown}\(\ell_2\){:/} attacks, outperforming even adversarially trained models at the largest epsilon tested. These findings provide evidence that inherently interpretable models represent a promising direction for both interpretability and robustness.

### 4. Qualitative Results

Driven by curiosity, I wanted to investigate how B-cos models' explanations and contribution maps change when attacked. Figures [2](#fig2), [3](#fig3), [4](#fig4), and [5](#fig5) illustrate a set of example inputs from the CIFAR10 test set, along with their attacked counterparts. These figures showcase the induced adversarial noise, the explanations and contribution maps generated by the B-cos models for both the normal and attacked inputs, and their corresponding differences.

Note that the difference images are per-row normalized to be between 0 and 1. Therefore, care should be taken when trying to interpret these images (refer to the associated colorbars for magnitude reference). 

#### 4.1 B-cos ResNet-56

Figures [2](#fig2) and [3](#fig3) depict the results for B-cos ResNet-56 with {::nomarkdown}\(\ell_2\){:/} and {::nomarkdown}\(\ell_\infty\){:/} attacks, respectively.

In the second column (frog) of [Figure 2](#fig2) for example, the adversarial noise exhibits a grid-like pattern reminiscent of a truck's front grille. This pattern is reflected in the corresponding attacked contribution map and may explain the model's misclassification of the input as a truck.

Similarly, in [Figure 3](#fig3), column 7 (cat) is misclassified as a dog. Examining its contribution map difference, it is plausible to interpret it as a dog's head rather than that of a cat.

#### 4.2 B-cos ResNet-50

Figures [4](#fig4) and [5](#fig5) depict the results for B-cos ResNet-50 with {::nomarkdown}\(\ell_2\){:/} and {::nomarkdown}\(\ell_\infty\){:/} attacks, respectively. We can see that the explanations for this model are less detailed and input-aligned than the ones for the B-cos ResNet-56 shown above. In addition, B-cos ResNet-50's contribution maps show a grid-like structure, which was not present for B-cos ResNet-56. These artifacts could be attributed to both the architectural differences between the two models, as well as the lack of fine-tuning done for the presented B-cos ResNet-50.

The {::nomarkdown}\(\ell_2\){:/} attack on the airplane image in [Figure 4](#fig4), column 4, was unsuccessful, and the corresponding attacked explanation remained largely unchanged. In contrast, the {::nomarkdown}\(\ell_\infty\){:/} attack in [Figure 5](#fig5) successfully misclassified the airplane image as a deer. This misclassification is reflected in the corresponding attacked explanation, which resembles a deer's antlers, and in the reduced attention to the airplane engine in the attacked contribution map

#### 4.3 Adversarial Noise Comparison

Finally, I found it interesting to see the differences in adversarial noise produced by naturally, adversarially, and B-cos trained networks. [Figure 6](#fig6) shows a different set of inputs from the CIFAR10 test set, along with their corresponding adversarial noises generated by the four different models. The adversarially trained model was trained against {::nomarkdown}\({\ell_2}\){:/} PGD attacks with {::nomarkdown}\({\epsilon=0.5}\){:/}. The adversarial attack depicted is an {::nomarkdown}\({\ell_2}\){:/} PGD attack with 100 steps and {::nomarkdown}\({\epsilon=0.5}\){:/}. From the figure, it is evident that the adversarial noise generated by the standard model is more noisy and granular, while the adversarially trained model's noise is more structural and input-aligned. The adversarial noise generated by the B-cos models appears to fall between the two.

### 5. Conclusion

While it was not rigorously investigated, as this was not the intent behind this post, B-cos models exhibited inherent robustness, especially against {::nomarkdown}\(\ell_2\){:/} PGD attacks, even surpassing adversarially trained models for the largest epsilon tested. In some instances, B-cos' explanations and contribution maps shed light on why the model might have changed its decision. However, to draw firm conclusions on the robustness of B-cos models, a fairer and more comprehensive evaluation encompassing a variety of attacks is warranted. Additionally, it would be interesting to investigate the transferability of adversarial examples for B-cos models, the impact of B-cos hyperparameters (e.g., different B's) on robustness, and whether adversarial training could further enhance their robustness and weight-input alignment.
