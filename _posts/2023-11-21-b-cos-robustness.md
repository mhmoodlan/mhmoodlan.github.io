> *Update-23-11-2023: As correctly noted by [Navdeeppal Singh](https://github.com/mhmoodlan/b-cos-robustness/issues/1#issue-2007844720), the comparison between ResNet-50 and B-cos ResNet-56 is not fair, due to architectural, augmentation, and hyperparameter differences. A previous version of this post claimed reproducing some results from [[3](#ref3)], which was inaccurate. The post was edited to reflect those notes.*

### 1. Introduction

Inherently interpretable models are a class of models that prioritize interpretability during the optimization process, contrasting with post-hoc interpretability methods that address interpretability after training is complete. B-cos models represent an example of inherently interpretable models. For a high-level overview, refer to this [post](https://moboehle.github.io/CoDA-Nets/){:target="_blank"}, [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdLYIzWWvw){:target="_blank"}, and [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NSSzXoWa2c){:target="_blank"}. For a more in-depth treatment, consult the papers on CoDA Nets [[1](#ref1)], B-cos Nets [[2](#ref2)], and B-cos ViTs [[3](#ref3)].

In this post, I attempt to train a B-cos ResNet-56 on CIFAR10 ([Section 2](#2-train-bcos)), evaluate its adversarial robustness, and compare it to naturally and adversarially trained networks, both quantitatively ([Section 3](#3-quantitative-results)) and qualitatively ([Section 4](#4-qualitative-results)). The code used to generate the results presented in this post can be found in this [notebook](https://github.com/mhmoodlan/b-cos-robustness/blob/main/b_cos_robustness.ipynb){:target="_blank"} or [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mhmoodlan/b-cos-robustness/blob/main/b_cos_robustness.ipynb).

### 2. Training B-cos ResNet-56

Executing the [published code](https://github.com/B-cos/B-cos-v2){:target="_blank"} was straightforward, *~~except for the need to modify `train-requirements.txt` to specify PyTorch Lightning's version to be `pytorch-lightning==1.9.0`, as Lighting versions from `2.0.0` upwards were incompatible~~[this has been fixed].* Specifically, I trained a Bcos-ResNet-56 model on CIFAR10 by running the command:
```bash
python train.py \
     --dataset CIFAR10 \
     --base_network norm_ablations_final \
     --experiment_name resnet_56-nomaxout
```
The obtained test accuracy was `88.06%`, which could be improved with more hyperparameter tuning. [Figure 1](#fig1) depicts the top-1 and top-5 accuracies on the train and evaluation sets throughout the 100 epochs of training. The trained checkpoint weights can be downloaded from [this repository](https://github.com/mhmoodlan/b-cos-robustness/releases/v0.1.0/){:target="_blank"}.

### 3. Quantitative Results

To evaluate the adversarial robustness of the trained B-cos model, I utilized the Robustness library [[4](#ref4)]. The library provides access to naturally and adversarially pretrained ResNet-50 models ([link to pretrained models](https://github.com/madrylab/robustness#pretrained-models){:target="_blank"}). In addition, this library makes it easy to attack a custom loss function, which comes in handy in this case due to the Binary Cross-Entropy loss function employed during the B-cos model training process.

Tables [1](#table1) and [2](#table2) present the accuracies of the models against {::nomarkdown}\(\ell_\infty\){:/} and {::nomarkdown}\(\ell_2\){:/} PGD attacks, respectively.  Each cell corresponds to the accuracy achieved against (20-step/100-step) PGD attacks with a step size of `2.5 * Îµ-test / num_steps`, following [[4](#ref4)]. The adv-ResNet-50 model in [Table 1](#table1) is an {::nomarkdown}\(\ell_\infty\) {:/} adversarially trained model with {::nomarkdown}\(\epsilon=8/255\){:/} ([model checkpoint](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c9qlt1lbdnu9tlo/cifar_linf_8.pt?dl=0){:target="_blank"}), while in [Table 2](#table2) it is an {::nomarkdown}\(\ell_2\) {:/} adversarially trained model with {::nomarkdown}\(\epsilon=0.5\){:/} ([model checkpoint](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1zazwjfzee7c8i4/cifar_l2_0_5.pt?dl=0){:target="_blank"}).

> It is important to note that the results presented herein should be interpreted with caution due to the disparity in architecture and data augmentation pipelines employed for the B-cos model and the provided ResNet-50 models. A more fair treatment would utilize a B-cos ResNet-50, however, due to computational limitations I setteled with the B-cos ResNet-56.

Interestingly, the B-cos model displayed modest inherent robustness, particularly against {::nomarkdown}\(\ell_2\){:/} attacks, unlike naturally trained models. This finding provides evidence that inherently interpretable models represent a promising direction for both interpretability and robustness.

### 4. Qualitative Results

Driven by curiosity, I wanted to investigate how B-cos models' explanations and contribution maps change when attacked. Figures [2](#fig2) and [3](#fig3) illustrate a set of example inputs from the CIFAR10 test set, along with their ({::nomarkdown}\(\ell_2\){:/} and {::nomarkdown}\(\ell_\infty\){:/}, respectively) attacked counterparts. These figures showcase the induced adversarial noise, the explanations and contribution maps generated by the B-cos model for both the normal and attacked inputs, and their corresponding differences.

Note that the difference images are per-row normalized to be between 0 and 1. Therefore, care should be taken when trying to interpret these images (refer to the associated colorbars for magnitude reference). 

As an example, in the second column (frog) of [Figure 2](#fig2), the adversarial noise exhibits a grid-like pattern reminiscent of a truck's front grille. This pattern is reflected in the corresponding attacked contribution map and may explain the model's misclassification of the input as a truck.

> Again, architectural differences between the visualized models should be kept in mind.

Similarly, in [Figure 3](#fig3), column 7 (cat) is misclassified as a dog. Examining its contribution map difference, it is plausible to interpret it as a dog's head rather than that of a cat.

        </p>
    </div>

Finally, I found it interesting to see the differences in adversarial noise produced by naturally, adversarially, and B-cos trained networks. [Figure 4](#fig4) shows a different set of inputs from the CIFAR10 test set, along with their corresponding adversarial noises generated by the three different models. The adversarially trained model was trained against {::nomarkdown}\({\ell_2}\){:/} PGD attacks with {::nomarkdown}\({\epsilon=0.5}\){:/}. The adversarial attack depicted is an {::nomarkdown}\({\ell_2}\){:/} PGD attack with 100 steps and {::nomarkdown}\({\epsilon=0.5}\){:/}. From the figure, it is evident that the adversarial noise generated by the standard model is more granular, while the adversarially trained model's noise is more structural and input-aligned. The adversarial noise generated by the B-cos model appears to fall between the two.

### 5. Conclusion

While it was not rigorously investigated, as this wasn't the intent behind this post, B-cos models exhibited inherent robustness against {::nomarkdown}\(\ell_2\){:/} PGD attacks. In some instances, B-cos' explanations and contribution maps shed light on why the model might have changed its decision. However, to draw firm conclusions on the robustness of B-cos models, a fairer and more comprehensive evaluation encompassing a variety of attacks is warranted. Additionally, it would be interesting to investigate the transferability of adversarial examples for B-cos models, the impact of B-cos hyperparameters (e.g., different B's) on robustness, and whether adversarial training could further enhance their robustness and weight-input alignment.
