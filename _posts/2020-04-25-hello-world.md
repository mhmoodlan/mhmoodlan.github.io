Reasons why this website exists:

- #### **Share knowledge**

    Acquiring knowledge by itself is not the goal, doing something useful with it, is. Sharing knowledge is one nobal such usage.

- #### **Practice Writing**

    Being able to write in a clear and concise way is an essential skill every knowledge worker must have, which requires a tremendous amount of practice, let alone when writing in a foriegn language. Plus, writting enhances one's thinking process in general.

- #### **Learn by Teaching**

    A well proven method to validate and deepen our understanding of what we learn is to simply try and explain it. In addition, blogging can be an organized way to document learning progress.

- #### **A Digital Escape**

    A place to share my thoughts away from the social-media's like-comment-share validation systems.

- #### **Convenience**

    In many instances, it is more convenient to communicate an idea with a simple animation rather than with a long paragraph of text. Here I am not restricted to the media types and limits enforced by third party platforms, I can embed whatever web technologies are needed to communicate.

- #### **Independence**

    To be independent from other platforms and to truly own the content and how it is being presented.
