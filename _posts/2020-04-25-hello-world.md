This blog is a way for me to learn. By explaining things, we can validate and deepen our understanding of what we learn. In addition, blogging can be an organized way to document learning progress and practice writing. In many instances, it is more convenient to communicate an idea with a simple animation rather than with a long paragraph of text. This website serves as a convenient and independent space where one can embed whatever web technologies are needed to communicate.
